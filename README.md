### overview
**target**
> P4 is a language for expressing how packets are processed by the data plane of a programmable forwarding element such as a hardware or software switch, network interface card, router, or network appliance. The name P4 comes from the original paper that introduced the language, “Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors,” https://​arxiv.​org/​pdf/​1312.​1719.​pdf. While P4 was initially designed for programming switches, its scope has been broadened to cover a large variety of devices. In the rest of this document we use the generic term target for all such devices.
